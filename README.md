# RideFare

## Description

The sharing economy has changed the way we transport ourselves.  Uber and Lyft are the biggest players in ride sharing, but who is cheaper?  This app answers that question.  A user enters a start location and an end location.  This can be done by typing addresses within the input boxes, or by using Google Maps to click start and end locations.  The values of those inputs are then used to call Uber's API and Lyft's API.  Once the data is received back, the app displays the results for the user thus showing which is cheaper to use.  We also show trip time and trip distance, thus giving a complete picture to the user which platform they would prefer to use.
